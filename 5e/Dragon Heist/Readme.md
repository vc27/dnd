# Character Building

List of things that are DM requests, possibilities and hooks. This story is all very low lever so I want to be sure that everyone is well hooked and drawn into the city, it's patrons and some kind of mischief.

### GM request to be an existing team

- I would like for all PCs to be on a team.
- The goal is to give the group cohesion from the start.
- It's totally fine to have issues with one another or to have distrust amongst the group.
- All that maters is that you can fight as a team when you need to.
- For various reasons your team has recently moved to Waterdeep from the norther city of Neverwinter.
- The team has been working on and off together for at least the last 1-3 yrs.
- Over the last year all of you have made at least one or two trips to the Waterdeep to secure local connections.

### Character hooks

**Leaving Neverwinter**

- Please give at least 1-2 reasons you pushed the team to leave the Neverwinter.
- Maybe you cut the wrong purse, maybe you slept with the tavern owners wife, maybe your family is too well known for you to make a name.
- What ever the reason, it can be easy or long, its just something to help me give you hooks outside of the standard module. More the better!

**Long history with Waterdeep**

- What ever personal history your character has with the city is your story.
- But for the last 1-3 years you have been working with the team with Neverwinter as your base.

**Recent history with Waterdeep**

- *(As mentioned above)* Over the last year all of you have made at least one or two trips to the Waterdeep to secure local connections.
- These trips were done independently so as to not stir suspicions.
- Because of these trips please select one contact from the [characters list](Characters).

**Some one needs a connection to Volothamp Geddarm**

- Through your trips to the city your party members has secured a job with [Volothamp Geddarm](Characters/Volothamp-Geddarm.md).
- You have no info yet, this will be your first meeting.
- You are to meet at the [Yawning Portal](Locations.md#yawning-portal)

# Things to know

- Xanathar's Thieves Guild and the Zhentarim Guild are continuously battling in the city.
