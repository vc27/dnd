# Character Building

- A little history
- 1 GM request
- Some character hooks

### Email

Welcome to the Waterdeep - Dragon Heist campaign! A little info dump then some requests for character hooks.

- 1st level
- Races: Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Tiefling
- Starting Gold 100gp (please remember that your background will provide you with a package of starting equipment)

**The Setting**

The setting will be in Waterdeep City so please try to make your character someone that will do well in a city scape or someone that is maybe attempting to leave their country life and become a city slicker.

**Dragon Heist Module**

I'll be roughly following the module, but would like to play it loose so we can keep things role play heavy if we need to. With that in mind please be sure to come up with response for at least one of the hooks below.

**Your Gang**

In an effort to give the group cohesion from the start everyone will be in the same gang. (gang, faction, team or what ever you want to call it) Your gang is transplanting itself from the northern city of Neverwinter.

Your Gang (Name TBD) has been around for 3yrs the found "Ardwund" died about a year ago on a side job for some unsavory characters he owed money too. Since then the remainder of the gang has been doing one off trips to the Waterdeep making contact to setup a job big enough to score your own hideout.

### Character hooks & history

**Leaving Neverwinter**

Please give at least 1 reason your character is pushing the gang to leave Neverwinter.

**Scouting trips to Waterdeep**

Over the last each of you has made at least one or two trips to the Waterdeep to either make local connections and learn the cities hierarchy.

As a result of these trips please select one contact from the [characters list](Characters). It doesn't matter if some of you choose the same NPC as your contact, just be sure it fits with your characters concept.

**Personal history with Waterdeep**

You may have what ever personal history you like with Waterdeep. However, for the last year 1-2 years you have been in Neverwinter. You have visited water deep but you have not "lived" there for at least 1-2 years.

# The Present

Your Gang is currently living in Waterdeep and has been there for 1-2 weeks getting settled in. The season is Autumn, which means you spent most of the spring and summer doing your reconnaissance. Autumn is harvest season so there is a bustle in the city which is partly why your team chose this time of year to make the move.

You have a meeting at the [Yawning Portal](Locations.md#yawning-portal) secured by proxy. You've been told to meet there by one or more of your contacts. Word has it a rich patron has paid your contact to find him a lesser known gang for a difficult task. Your contact says he's mostly good for his money, at bear minimum you'll get paid to hear his pitch.

# Knowledge your Gang has accumulated
