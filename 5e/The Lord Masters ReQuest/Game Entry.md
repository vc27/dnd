# Entry point
# ==============================

*GM to Players*

- You're here for one of the following:
  - captured for crimes of fuckery or worse
  - captured to pay a debt
  - abducted because you refused to go willingly
  - willingly went because you know what's going on

- You've woke at some point in the last hour, even if you came willingly.
- You're in a ship, hands and feet bound, there are at least 8 other humanoids.
- You're not hurt, in fact you feel amazing.
- You can see your gear, but you can't reach it.
- Your gear appears to have been cleaned, sharpened and prepped for battle.

*GM*

- Greeted by Master Morwenna Fera and Master Eglantine Agate.
- Master Morwenna is thin and wispy. Black hair, black eyes and smells as if she bathed in a broth of steeping tea leaves. Her fingers move with elegance but she looks as though she is nothing more than bone and sinew.
- Master Eglantine is thick, bordering fat. Smells like a dogs birth and is continuously chewing on some kind root. Only barely covered in some kind of hemp cloth he stands with a staff in hand.

*Master Morwenna*

Welcome my lovelies, welcome my sweets. Here we are once again, another fine fucking day where I have to piss in a bucket and shit off a plank. If you do not already know "why" you are here speak now.

*PCs*
Q & A

*Master Morwenna*

Enough! Know your place in the Lord Masters realm. We are docked in southern harbor of the Island of Morgue. A fucking original name that one.

Your job, your penance, your agreement* ... or what ever the fucks you want to call it is to claim the Island by forging a path to it's peak. Once you reach the peak you must drop the sphere of "x" into the active volcano. Once you are done you may return to this location and we will escort you back to a mainland port with compensations accordingly.

Master Eglantine will elaborate further.
