# History

### Chinese history

- [Qing dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty)
- Traveled to Beijing China with my parents
- Was trained by my fathers personal assistant in arts of martial warfare and espionage
- Was trained to fight in simple hand to hand combat as well as Tantos and Shuriken
- Was taught to speak and act as a Japanese noble
- Learned to Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect
- Learned the art of the Yanmaodao sword, trained in the form of Qing dynasty
- My father was well aware of the appearance of his actions, but believed they were necessary to advance the clan in this new era.
- My father was also aware that if I was to return to Japan with an chance I would need to be able to ultimately fend for my self and reposition myself and our family. To do this I would need an intensive training of the body and mind.
- I was also taught the expansive Chinese game of "Go".

### Personal History

- Family moved from Japan to China as international trade advisors which was seen as betraying their clan.
- At age 24 returns to family estate which has been kept up by the serving families under a trust left by my parents.
- Kanezane's return is of political need, the current estate of the family is under duress. When Kanezane return he found the estate in similar condition to when he left it, but he do not have access to anything financially. Apart from the ability to stay at the estate and utilize it's comforts he is essentially of little wealth.
- Kanezane noble name, Kujō, is all that he has left from the onlooking eyes of society.
- Kanezane returned to his home town 2 years ago and has been living his life quietly.

### Dual lives

Kanezane lives a dual life. He is a well groomed man of position and wealth. His daily routine is to see to his family estate needs as well as regional ties and factions. When he hears words of corruption or miss dealing with in his clan or aimed at his clan he takes action.

When Kanezane fights he chooses the best blade for the task, he doesn't favor one tool over the other necessarily.
